<!--
* In the future, book_title should have an affiliate link to amazon
* Add a "comment" link which, upon click, goes to the comment page for the book
* Clikc on the "like" button increments the votes count instantaneously.
  However, we'll use the session cookie to allow incrementing for a book only once.

class="no-underline" -> to disable underlining the link when mouse over it.

For the button, use literal "Like"
          <td><button class ="btn btn-default btn-block btn-xs btn-primary" type ="button" >Like</button></td> 

or glyphicon-arrow-up to indicate "upvote". HOwever, upvote could be kind of confusing.

See http://getbootstrap.com/components/ for more glyphicon's
